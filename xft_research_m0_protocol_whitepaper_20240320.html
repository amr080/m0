The protocol enforces a common set of rules and safety procedures for the management of <i>M</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="I."><h2 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Introduction</h2><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The <i>core </i>M^0 protocol (which excludes periphery contracts<span class="s6">1</span> and is hereon referred to simply as the M^0 protocol) is a coordination layer for permissioned actors to generate <i><b>M</b></i>. <i>M </i>is a crypto asset whose value is designed to be a robust representation of an exogenous collateral basket – a relationship enforced by the financial structure and market incentives of its generators. The purpose of <i>M </i>is to become a superior building block for value representation, by combining the convenience of digital money with the risk profile of physical cash. While holders may find this construct appropriate as a vehicle for <i>cryptodollar </i>use cases, developers and financial services providers might be interested in it as raw material for the build out of novel products and services – including as collateral for cryptodollars.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">When cash was primarily a physical construct, it had several properties that its holders found desirable but have since been lost in the process of digitization. Physical cash is first and foremost self-custodial; it’s a bearer instrument which guarantees that it cannot be frozen or seized without due process in the holder’s jurisdiction. For example, holders in one nation do not need to be concerned that a far away government can <i>turn off </i>the cash in their pocket. This feature allows cash to be credibly neutral, which means that it cannot discriminate against any specific holder. Second, physical cash does not carry additional counterparty risk, it is as good as holding reserves at the issuer’s central bank. Finally, physical cash is generally fungible with itself, which is to say that except in extraordinary circumstances where holders are wary to accept a certain serial number, no bill is more or less valuable than another. The downsides of physical cash are that it cannot be transferred electronically, it must be stored in a physically safe location which becomes exponentially more difficult to secure as the quantity held rises, is becoming less broadly accepted as a means of payment, and lacks general digital properties that can allow seamless composability and programmability.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1<span class="s9"> A periphery contract is a smart contract that adds supplement functionality, but exists outside of the core protocol.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Most users have historically believed those properties to be inherited by bank deposits, as if they were merely a digital representation of cash — the fallacy of this false equivalence is becoming evident due to the stress increasingly experienced by the banking system, and is exacerbated by the global nature of cryptodollars. What we call <i>digital cash </i>today is typically a commercial bank deposit that can be transferred electronically. It has several beneficial features such as the ability to earn interest, the ability to be transferred over the internet and across large distances, and it offers the peace of mind of digital and custodial security. It is also the most widely accepted form of payment through credit cards, debit cards, ACH, and SWIFT. Unfortunately bank deposits lose many of the desirable features of physical cash. Bank deposits are implicitly custodial and can be seized or frozen without due process in the holder’s jurisdiction – they are not credibly neutral. Due to the inherent characteristics of fractional reserve banking, bank deposits hold significant counterparty risk and are only as valuable as the specific bank’s balance sheet permits. For this reason they are also not fungible. A deposit in one bank cannot be treated as equal to a deposit in another, and thus introduces exorbitant clearing times between payments, as well as compounding complexity throughout the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">M <span class="p">is credibly neutral by design, it is by default self-custodial and fungible. Each </span>M <span class="p">is the same as every other </span>M <span class="p">and there is no ability for the protocol to discriminate against any specific holder(s). </span>M <span class="p">is stored and tracked on blockchains, and thus can be stored more securely at scale than physical cash. </span>M<span class="p">’s current instantiation is intended to be generated using short term US T-bills, representing the lowest level of counterparty risk excepting physical cash and bank reserves within the US dollar system. The T-bills used to generate </span>M <span class="p">must be held exclusively throughout a network of orphaned, bankruptcy-remote entities, which are customized to interact with the M^0 protocol while meeting the formalities of the existing legal system. </span>M <span class="p">can be sent anywhere in the world instantaneously using the blockchain rails on which it exists. Interest flowing to the T-bill collateral can be partly collected by the protocol and democratized across permissioned issuers and distributors.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">We refer to <i>M </i>as raw material for value representation, and not necessarily a cryptodollar in its own right, because the system relies on permissioned issuers (known as <i>Minters </i>in the protocol) for generation and distribution. These Minters should be compliant with all applicable regulations and may decide to distribute their own product, for example by wrapping the <i>M </i>token in a cryptodollar contract in a way that best meets their requirements. In this capacity, <i>M </i>becomes a monetary building block on top of which novel products can be built.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">In summary, the M^0 protocol introduces a superior coordination mechanism that democratizes access to the generation and management of programmable, digital cash instruments. It is an infrastructure layer not for the simplistic tokenization of real world bank deposits, but a much more sophisticated way to provide access to the liquidity on high-quality collateral. M^0 intends</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">to redesign the monetary vertical stack, rather than build an additional layer on top of what has ultimately become byzantine infrastructure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="II."><h2 style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: left;">Protocol</h2><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The M^0 protocol is a set of immutable smart contracts implemented for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It receives all external inputs from a governance mechanism called the M^0 Two Token Governor, <i>TTG</i>, (see III. Governance). The M^0 protocol is a coordination tool for actors permissioned by governance, namely <i>Minters</i>, <i>Validators</i>, and <i>Earners</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="II.I"><h3 style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -25pt;text-align: left;">Operation</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Aside from users accessing the <i>M </i>token, which is permissionless, only actors permissioned through the TTG mechanism have access to the M^0 Protocol. The primary actors in the protocol are called Minters and Validators (see III.II Governance Controlled Protocol Actors). Once permissioned by the TTG, Minters and Validators are able to access certain methods in the smart contracts which facilitate the creation, maintenance, and destruction of <i>M</i>. <i>M </i>is a standard ERC20 token. The core operating condition of the M^0 protocol is to ensure that all <i>M </i>in existence is backed by an equal or greater amount of value <i><b>Eligible Collateral </b></i>that is held in an <i><b>Eligible Custody Solution </b></i>(see IV.II Off-Chain Actors and Components). In this context, the protocol acts as the enforcer of a set of rules which controls the generation of <i>M</i>, the validation of collateral custody and value, and the assessment of fees when appropriate.</p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="II.I.I"><h4 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">Generation of <i>M</i></h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">In order to generate <i>M</i>, Minters must have a sufficient off-chain balance of Eligible Collateral which is represented on-chain by a frequently updated and validated number, known as the on-chain <i><b>Collateral Value</b></i>. Minters call the <b>Update Collateral </b>method to put this number on-chain. They must pass the amount, the list of signing Validators, a list of timestamps associated with the Validator signatures, and valid signature data (from Validators). Whenever timestamps and signature data are passed to a method, the contracts will take the minimum timestamp and the minimum threshold of signatures as defined by the TTG (see III.III Governance Controlled TTG Parameters). Optionally, they can pass a hash of arbitrary metadata and any open Retrieval IDs (see II.I.IV Retrieving Free Collateral) into the method as an argument. The Metadata Hash can be used to retrieve the actual off-chain metadata, which can serve to add context to the update, while Retrieval IDs allow Minters to remove outstanding balance subtractions (see II.I.IV Retrieving Free Collateral). Signature validation may either use</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">standard <i>ecrecover</i><i>2</i>, which allows for the Minter to obtain the signature off-chain, or EIP-1271 on-chain contract signatures<span class="s6">3</span>. The collateral balance is an attestation to the value of the Eligible Collateral held in an Eligible Custody Solution (see IV.II Off-Chain Actors and Components for further details).</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">In order to post the value of their Eligible Collateral on-chain, the Minter will need to provide the signature data (from Validators) in the transaction. The presence of the Validator’s signature is to reinforce that the value of the Eligible Collateral is correct and reflects the most up-to-date snapshot of the off-chain balances. Minters must update their Eligible Collateral number on-chain and with a valid Validator signature <i>at least </i>once every <i><b>Update Collateral Interval </b></i>(see II.III Governance Controlled Protocol Parameters). If a Minter fails to call Update Collateral within Update Collateral Interval of the previous time they called it, their on-chain Collateral Value is assumed to be 0. If the Minter cannot provide valid signature data (from Validators), they cannot successfully call the method. Each time this method is called it will accrue the <i><b>Minter Rate </b></i>(see II.I.II Protocol Fees) on the Minter’s current balance of Owed M. If any rules are being violated at the time of the method being called, it will also charge <i><b>Penalty Rate </b></i>on the Minter’s balance which is in violation (see II.I.II Protocol Fees).</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Example: Eligible Collateral for M has been deemed to be 0-90 day T-bills. Minter 1 has</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">$10,000,000 of T-bills sitting in an Eligible Custody Solution. Minter 1 calls Update Collateral and passes 10,000,000, and a valid Validator signature as arguments. The on-chain Collateral Value of the Minter is now 10,000,000. The next day, $1,000,000 of the T-bills mature and convert to bank deposits, which are not considered Eligible Collateral. The Minter calls Update Collateral and passes 9,000,000, and a valid Validator signature as arguments. The on-chain collateral balance of the Minter is updated to 9,000,000.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Once a Minter has updated their on-chain collateral they are able to generate <i>M</i>. They do so by calling the <b>Propose Mint </b>method and passing in the amount of <i>M </i>they’d like to generate and the address which they would like to generate the <i>M </i>to. Once this method is called, it will first call <b>Get Present Amount </b>on the Minter&#39;s current balance of Owed M. It will then check to ensure that the on-chain Collateral Value multiplied by the <i><b>Mint Ratio </b></i>(see II.III Governance Controlled Protocol Parameters), including the amount they are currently attempting to generate and/or <i><b>Retrieve </b></i>(see II.I.IV Retrieving Free Collateral), is greater than the amount of total Owed M from the Minter. If these checks are passed the method will output a <i><b>Mint ID </b></i>which corresponds to the Propose Mint. A Minter can only have one outstanding Mint ID at any given time. If after the <i><b>Mint Delay </b></i>(see II.III Governance Controlled Protocol Parameters) the Mint ID has not been canceled by the Validator (see II.I.III Cancel and Freeze), the Minter may call the <b>Mint M </b>method and pass the Mint ID as an argument to execute the Propose Mint. The Mint Delay was</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2<a href="https://soliditydeveloper.com/ecrecover" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10pt;" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://soliditydeveloper.com/ecrecover" target="_blank">https://soliditydeveloper.com/ecrecover</a></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10pt;" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271" target="_blank">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">introduced to avoid atomic Update Collateral calls and Mint calls, and to provide the network of Validators with sufficient opportunity to intervene in the minting process if something is seemingly wrong (see II.I.III Cancel and Freeze). The Minter must call Mint M before the <i><b>Propose Mint Time To Live </b></i>has expired (see II.III Governance Controlled Protocol Parameters). Minters can destroy Owed M at any time by calling the <b>Burn </b>method and passing in their Minter Address and the amount of <i>M </i>they’d like to burn as arguments. Any address can repay <i>M </i>owed by a Minter by calling the Burn method and passing in the amount and Minter address as arguments.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The <i>M </i>generation process and its limiting factors</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="II.I.II"><h4 style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -32pt;text-align: justify;">Protocol Fees</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">There are two fees assessed on Minters in the M^0 protocol. The first is called Minter Rate, a governance controlled parameter, which is levied continuously on the Minter’s balance of Owed</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">M. This fee compounds on a continuous basis. The beneficiaries of Minter Rate are the <i><b>Earn Mechanism </b></i>(see II.I.V The Earn Mechanism) and the <i><b>ZERO </b></i>holders (see III. Governance). The second is Penalty Rate, another governance controlled parameter, which is levied on balances that are in violation of protocol rules and has the same beneficiaries as the Minter Rate. One of the primary invariants of the protocol is that the balance of a Minter’s Owed M should not exceed the on-chain Collateral Value (sans open Retrieval IDs) multiplied by the Mint Ratio. Penalty Rate is imposed upon any balance in excess of this amount. If a Minter has not called Update Collateral within Update Collateral Interval, they will incur Penalty Rate on their entire balance of Owed M for each Update Collateral Interval that they miss – i.e. when Update Collateral is not called in the TTG-specified time, the system interprets its value to be zero. Unlike Minter Rate, Penalty Rate is not continuously levied on the Minter’s balance of Owed M, but is charged discretely as a one-time percentage fee on their delinquent balance at the moment the balance is checked, and then added to the Minter’s Owed M. Collecting the Minter Rate is contained in the Get Present Amount method, which is exclusively embedded in all other Minter methods and cannot be called independently. It is called in most methods, including Burn. The Minter Rate is mechanically affected by updating a global index value which is applied to all Owed M in the Minter’s balance, as is Penalty Rate. Penalty Rate is contained in the <b>Impose Penalty </b>method, which is exclusively embedded in the Update Collateral,Burn, and <b>Deactivate Minter </b>methods. When Impose Penalty is called in conjunction with Update Collateral, it checks</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">for both missed Update Collateral Interval periods and the Minter’s balance of Owed M relative to their on-chain Collateral Value discounted by the Mint Ratio. When it is called in conjunction with Burn, it only checks for missed Update Collateral Interval periods. This is done to ensure that the Minter is not penalized on the same errant balance more than once. Impose Penalty will also account for whether it has already been called in the current Update Collateral Interval period and will not charge a Minter twice for the same missed period.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Example: A Minter calls Update Collateral; the Get Present Amount method is called along with the Impose Penalty method. The Minter’s balance of Owed M prior to the method call is 8,000,000 M. First, Get Present Amount is used to fetch the latest index and apply the Minter Rate to the Minter’s balance of Owed M, accounting for continuous compounding. Assume that this increases the Minter’s Owed M to 8,000,010 M. If the Minter’s on-chain Collateral Value is 8,000,000 and the Mint Ratio is 90%, then the maximum amount of Owed M Minter 1 should have is 7,200,000 M– but the actual on-chain number is 8,000,010 M. Therefore Minter 1 will incur Penalty Rate on (8,000,010 M - 7,200,000 M)=800,010 M. If Penalty Rate is 0.01%, then the Minter’s Owed M is incremented to 8,000,010 M + 800,010 M* 1.0001 = 800,090.001 M.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The following is a diagram which demonstrates a hypothetical sequence where a Minter incurs Penalty Rate charges.

Assume that less than 48 hours have passed since the Mint call on Day 1. First, Get Present Amount is called and applies the latest index to the Minter’s balance of 90 M. This increases the Minter’s Owed M to (90 * (1 + (0.0000058 * 48))) = 90.025 M. Next, Impose Penalty is called and is applied to the Minter’s updated balance. Since the Minter missed one Update Collateral Interval period (on Day 2), they are penalized one time. The Minter’s Owed M is increased to (90.025 * (1 + (0.0002 * 1)) =</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">90.043 M. The amount passed into the Burn method (50.043) is now subtracted from this new balance and reduces the Minter’s Owed M to (90.043 - 50.043) = 40 M. Recall that burn only checks for missed Update Collateral Interval periods and does not check the Minter’s current on-chain Collateral Value and therefore does not penalize any currently errant balance. The Minter then calls Burn again on Day 3 and passes in 30.0014 M. Assume 6 hours have passed since the previous Burn call. First, Get Present Amount is called and applies the latest index to the Minter’s balance of 40 M. This increases the Minter’s Owed M to (40 * (1 + (0.0000058 * 6))) = 40.0014 M. Impose Penalty is then run but does not charge the Minter an additional Penalty Rate because it has already paid for all missed Update Collateral Interval periods. The amount passed into the Burn method (30.0014) is now subtracted from this new balance and reduces the Minter’s Owed M to (40.0014 - 30.0014) = 10 M. Finally, also on Day 3, the Minter calls Update Collateral and passes in 0 (most likely because their Eligible Collateral has matured and is sitting in ineligible bank deposits). Assume another 6 hours have passed. Once again, Get Present Amount is run to apply the latest index to the Minter’s balance of M. This increases the Minter’s Owed M by (10 * (1 + (0.0000058 * 6))) = 10.00035 M. Next Impose Penalty is called. There are no charges for missed periods because these were already paid when the Minter called Burn. A check for an errant balance is now run and produces 10.00035 M since the Minter’s entire balance is in excess of their maximum permitted Owed M due to the on-chain Collateral Value being 0. The Minter’s Owed M is increased to (10.00035 * 1.0002) = 10.00235 M.</p></li><li data-list-text="II.I.III"><h4 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -37pt;text-align: justify;">Cancel and Freeze</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">There are two methods which can be used to stop an errant generation of <i>M </i>or to stop an errant Minter in the case of an emergency.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The first method, <b>Cancel</b>, can be called by any Validator on any Mint ID associated with the generation of <i>M</i>. The calling actor must pass the Mint ID as an argument to the method. Calling this method will cancel the specified Mint ID and cancel the proposal. The Cancel method can be called at any time until Mint is called.

Like most methods this will first call Get Present Amount. After that it will check that the on-chain Collateral Value, after subtracting the amount the Minter is trying to retrieve and any other open Retrieval IDs, is sufficient to support the Minter’s remaining balance of Owed M. Unlike Propose Mint, which is limited to one Mint ID at a time, there is not a limit to the number of outstanding Retrieval IDs. If this check passes, it will sideline this balance to be deducted from future calculations where it is relevant. Finally it outputs a <i><b>Retrieval ID</b></i>.

The Earner Rate, while input as an explicit value from the TTG, is bound in the smart contracts to be the lower of its input value or the maximum it can be without expending more <i>M </i>than is accruing from Minter Rate. To elaborate, the <i>utilization </i>of the Earn Mechanism can be considered to be the total amount of Owed M that is currently paying the Minter Rate (hereon referred to as <i>active M</i>) divided by the total amount of <i>M </i>in the Earn Mechanism. If a Minter is depermissioned by the TTG, their <i>M </i>will be deducted from the active M and thus lower utilization.

Once an actor is removed they are no longer able to call the methods in the contracts, preventing them from engaging in further activity with the protocol. Once a Minter is removed from the Minter list, they cease to pay the Minter Rate on their Owed M. The value of current Owed <i>M</i>, and potentially penalties for missed intervals, is stored for repayment by the Minter or anyone interested in their off-chain collateral retrieval. This is to ensure that <i>M </i>does not get paid to the Earn Mechanism and to the <i>ZERO </i>holders if a Minter is no longer actively in the system. The Burn method always remains available to anyone even if a Minter is no longer permissioned. This ensures that off-chain actors can facilitate the winddown of the Minter’s operations and destroy the Owed M in order to retrieve the value from the Eligible Custody Solution.

TTG stands for <i>Two Token Govern</i>or and is a mechanism by which holders of the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">voting tokens are penalized for failing to vote. There are two utility tokens used in the M^0 TTG: <i><b>POWER </b></i>and <i>ZERO</i>. <i>POWER </i>is used to vote on active proposals and can be considered the primary management token of the mechanism. <i>POWER </i>holders will earn <i>ZERO </i>in exchange for their direct participation in governance. If a <i>POWER </i>holder delegates their balance to an address that is not also the holder of the tokens, it is this address which receives the <i>ZERO </i>rewards. <i>ZERO </i>holders are comparatively (to <i>POWER </i>holders) passive in the voting process and only vote on important changes. <i>ZERO </i>holders at any time may <b>Reset </b>(see: III.II.II.III ZERO Threshold Proposals) the <i>POWER </i>token supply to themselves. The goal of the TTG mechanism is to ensure credible neutrality of governance. In any system there are two extremes that must be avoided: capture and fraud. In one case, the system is captured by actors whose primary interest is not in efficient protocol operation and it ceases to function in a way where all users are treated the same. In the other, the protocol ceases to function for anyone except the fraudulent actor. It is this dichotomy that is at the heart of the two token design. <i>POWER </i>holders are treated as a managerial class that is able to earn compensation through continued benevolent participation. This continued benevolence is judged by the <i>ZERO </i>holders who can always strip the <i>POWER </i>holders of their management rights, and thus their ability to earn future ownership in the protocol. If the composition and decisions of <i>POWER </i>holders trend towards either extreme, it is in the interest of <i>ZERO </i>holders to call Reset in order to restore balance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l4"><li data-list-text="III.I"><h3 style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -30pt;text-align: left;">Inputs</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The M^0 TTG (hereafter TTG) is responsible for the following inputs to the M^0 protocol and to itself (see Section III.III Governance Controlled TTG Parameters, Section II.II Governance Controlled Protocol Actors, and Section II.III Governance Controlled Protocol Parameters for further context on the actors and parameters listed below):</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Governance Controlled TTG Parameters</h4><ul id="l5"><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Proposal Fee</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">POWER <span class="p">Threshold</span></p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">ZERO <span class="p">Threshold</span></p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">CASH Toggle</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Governance Controlled Protocol Actors</h4></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">A list of approved Minters</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">A list of approved Validators</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">A list of Approved Earners</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Governance Controlled Protocol Parameters</h4></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Minter Rate</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Penalty Rate</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Earner Rate</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Mint Ratio</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Mint Delay</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Propose Mint Time To Live</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Update Collateral Interval</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Number of Signatures</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Minter Freeze Time</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="III.II"><h3 style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: left;">Operation</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The TTG is used to vote on proposals seeking to amend the actors and variables. New lists and variables may be added arbitrarily over time, however the core protocol is immutable and these additions will not directly impact its operations.

In practice, this broader epoch is split into two epochs of 15 days. These numbers were chosen to align with an average calendar month. The first epoch (the <b>Transfer Epoch</b>) is a non-voting period where transfers and delegation are enabled. The second 15-day epoch (the <i><b>Voting Epoch</b></i>) is where voting takes place on Standard Proposals and transfers and delegation are disabled. These restrictions on on-chain activity only apply to <i>POWER </i>tokens, there are no restrictions placed on the <i>ZERO </i>token. The conceptual 30-day epoch is split into these two smaller epochs to ensure correct accounting for voting and inflation. This means that proposals are collected in one 15-day epoch (whether it be the Voting Epoch or the Transfer Epoch), are voted on in the following 15-day Voting Epoch, and should be executed in the following 15-day Transfer Epoch. Proposals that passed but were not executed eventually expire. Therefore a proposal may spend as short as 15 days plus two blocks, or as long as 60 days, from submission to execution. During the 15-day Transfer Epoch, holders may transfer their balances, reassign delegations, and purchase <i>POWER </i>that is being auctioned.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Diagram showing the Transfer and Voting Epochs</p></li><li data-list-text="III.II.II"><h4 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -41pt;text-align: left;">Proposals</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The TTG has three types of proposals: (1) <i><b>Standard Proposals</b></i>, (2) <i><b>POWER Threshold Proposals</b></i>, and (3) <i><b>ZERO Threshold Proposals</b></i>. The use of threshold in the terminology represents a <i>yes threshold</i>, meaning that the threshold percentage of yes votes must be reached in order for the proposal to pass. A proposal that requires a threshold never explicitly fails (although it will eventually expire), but cannot be executed without reaching the requisite number of yes votes. For example, if a proposal requires a 10% yes threshold, it will pass as soon as 10% of the relevant token supply has voted yes. If this proposal never reaches 10% of the relevant token supply voting yes, it will expire without passing. These proposal types are described below in further detail.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l7"><li data-list-text="III.II.II.I"><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -49pt;text-align: justify;">Standard Proposals</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Standard Proposals are voteable only by <i>POWER </i>holders and require a simple majority of participating tokens to pass. Standard proposals do not require a threshold percentage of yes votes to pass. If there are only 100 <i>POWER </i>tokens voting in a Standard Proposal and 51 vote yes while 49 vote no, it will pass. If 50 vote yes and 50 vote no, it will fail as it requires the yes balance to exceed the no. Standard Proposals are the only proposal type which are “mandatory” for POWER holder participation. Lack of participation will result in POWER holders being diluted in terms of their overall voting power in the system and will cause them to forfeit any ZERO rewards for which they were otherwise eligible. A successful Standard Proposal will have its Proposal Fee available to be returned to the proposer.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Example: During a Voting Epoch a proposal to change Minter Rate is made. Only 10% of the POWER tokens choose to participate. When voting on the proposal, 60% of the participating POWER tokens vote yes. This proposal is passed because the yes votes are greater than the no votes. The total number of POWER holders participating is only relevant in votes which require a POWER Threshold.</p></li><li data-list-text="III.II.II.II"><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: justify;">POWER Threshold Proposals</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">A <i>POWER </i>Threshold Proposal can be used to submit anything which would otherwise be a Standard Proposal, except it requires a <i>POWER </i>Threshold and is immediately votable and subsequently immediately executable rather than only being votable and executable in the future epochs. For this reason, <i>POWER </i>holders are likely to use this proposal type in the case of an urgent or emergency situation. If a <i>POWER </i>Threshold has not been reached before the proposal expires, the proposal cannot be executed. <i>POWER </i>Threshold Proposals expire at the end of the next epoch.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Example: During the Transfer Period a POWER Threshold Proposal is made to change Minter Rate, which requires a POWER Threshold due to it being an POWER Threshold Proposal. The POWER Threshold is set to 75%. The proposal becomes immediately votable and a full 100% of the POWER supply chooses to participate – 80% vote affirmatively. This proposal has passed and is instantly executable upon the POWER Threshold being met. This is because it achieved yes votes from greater than 75% of the POWER supply (100% * 80% = 80% yes). Note that the proposal very well could have gone on to accumulate more yes votes, but was likely executed immediately or soon after meeting the POWER Threshold.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="III.II.II.III"><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -58pt;text-align: justify;">ZERO Threshold Proposal</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">A <i>ZERO </i>Threshold Proposal is used for Reset, to toggle CASH between <i>WETH </i>and <i>M</i>, and to set the <i>POWER </i>and <i>ZERO </i>Thresholds themselves. The Reset method is a special feature reserved for the <i>ZERO </i>token holders which allows a yes threshold of <i>ZERO </i>holders to change the current governor of the system to a new version with a new <i>POWER </i>token that is claimable pro rata to <i>ZERO </i>holders or to existing <i>POWER </i>holders. They do this by creating a proposal to call the Reset method. Mechanically this is affected by replacing the current governor (<i>POWER </i>token address) of the system with a new instance, where the starting balance of the <i>POWER </i>tokens are proportional to each <i>ZERO </i>holder&#39;s balance in the epoch before the Reset. It is immediately executable upon achieving a yes threshold. It is intended for <i>ZERO </i>holders to use this feature should they find something irreparably wrong with the composition and/or voting patterns of the current <i>POWER </i>holders and wish to take on voting responsibility themselves. It is anticipated that <i>ZERO </i>holders will only Reset the governor to the existing <i>POWER </i>holders if the token is nearing an overflow, which will not happen for 150+ years. There is technically no limit to how many times Reset can be called, but it is not anticipated to be frequently used (if it is ever used in the first place). If a Reset is executed in the middle of a Voting Epoch, all active and/or unexecuted proposals are effectively canceled because they are using the obsolete governor.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Example: The ZERO Threshold is set to 60%. POWER holders seem likely to pass a proposal to add a perceived malicious actor to the Minter List. A user submits a proposal to Reset.

During a Transfer Epoch, only the balance a user possessed at the checkpoint will be counted towards voting on <i>POWER </i>Threshold Proposals, which will not include standard inflationary proposals by definition. In order to vote the <i>POWER </i>owner’s delegate address (hereon referred to as the <i>POWER </i>holder) calls the <b>Cast Votes </b>method on the array of proposals they wish to vote on and specifies yes/no for each proposal. There is no abstain option in the TTG.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="III.II.IV"><h4 style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -45pt;text-align: left;">Proposing</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Anyone with an ethereum address and <i><b>WETH </b></i>or <i>M </i>may submit a proposal. The TTG is to be deployed with <i>WETH </i>as its internal currency (known as <i>CASH </i>in the mechanism), and therefore any Standard Proposal submission must pay a Proposal Fee in <i>WETH, </i>or at a later date <i>M </i>depending on the current CASH toggle setting, in addition to gas fees (see III.III Governance Controlled TTG Parameters). A proposal that passes makes the Proposal Fee available to be returned to the proposer upon execution.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">There are two primary structures of proposals that can be managed through the TTG: (1) configuring a registrar used by the protocol, i.e. adding and removing addresses from arbitrary lists/sets and setting arbitrary variables; (2) setting governance parameters. The M^0 protocol looks to the registrar to use certain variables and sets of addresses in its processes.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">In order to propose a change to a list, a user submits a Standard Proposal or a <i>POWER </i>Threshold Proposal calling the <b>Add To List </b>or <b>Remove From List </b>methods along with the address they wish to add or remove. There is also a method called <b>Remove From And Add To List </b>which facilitates swapping an address on a list. In order to add a new list to the TTG a proposer will create a proposal which uses Add To List and will specify a new list, which is created simultaneously to the proposal being executed. Since the M^0 core protocol is immutable, any list added after deployment can only be used to manage periphery smart contracts and cannot impact core operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Example: Alice wishes to add her company’s address to the list of approved Minters in the M^0 protocol.

This inflation is claimed <i>pro rata </i>by participating <i>POWER </i>holders, specifically by the delegate address. Any <i>POWER </i>that remains undistributed (or that could not be claimed because the holder did not fully participate in that epoch) is auctioned off to the highest bidder in a pay-as-bid Dutch auction (hereon “Dutch auction”).

When a Standard Proposal becomes available for voting, it is mandatory for <i>POWER </i>holders to vote on it or else the owner of the <i>POWER </i>tokens will lose relative voting weight in the system. If a <i>POWER </i>owner’s delegate fails to vote on <i>any </i>proposal in an epoch, they will forfeit any <i>POWER </i>or <i>ZERO </i>inflation they would have otherwise been able to claim. <i>POWER </i>holders must vote on all Standard Proposals in the Voting Epoch; <i>POWER </i>Threshold Proposals and <i>ZERO </i>Threshold Proposals do not factor into <i>POWER </i>inflation dynamics. There is no inflation if an epoch only has <i>POWER </i>Threshold Proposals and/or <i>ZERO </i>Threshold Proposals, or no proposals at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><u>Example:</u> Alice is a POWER holder with 1,000 POWER tokens, the total POWER supply is 10,000; hence Alice controls 10% of the POWER voting weight. In epoch 1 she participates fully by voting on all Standard Proposals. Simultaneous to participating, Alice claims an additional 100 POWER tokens and 500,000 ZERO tokens, i.e. 10% of a POWER inflation of 1,000 tokens and 10% of a ZERO inflation of 5,000,000 tokens. In epoch 2 Alice fails to vote on a Standard Proposal and is therefore not able to claim any POWER or ZERO tokens. The 110 POWER tokens (i.e. 10% of the new additional POWER supply of 1,100 tokens) that should have gone to Alice are auctioned in the Dutch auction. Bob buys these 110 tokens for 1 WETH (the internal currency of the TTG) and can now participate in the following voting epoch. The ZERO tokens that should have gone to Alice are simply never minted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="III.II.VI"><h4 style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -45pt;text-align: left;">Dutch Auction</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Once the Transfer Epoch has begun the Dutch auction will begin simultaneously if any <i>POWER </i>holder failed to participate.

During the period between exponent decreases the price linearly declines. This means that after the first 3.6 hours of the auction the price will be 2<span class="s6">98</span> wei and linearly decrease to 2<span class="s6">97</span> wei over the following 3.6 hours. In the implementation, bitwise shifting is used to achieve this effect. That is to say that at the midpoint between two exponents, the value is halfway between them.

The lack of decimals (and thus lack of subdivision of tokens) was also chosen for this reason. See the diagram under <i>POWER </i>Inflator for further analysis. Another factor to consider in this initial supply is the “dust level,” meaning the level at which in a Reset a <i>ZERO </i>holder would not receive any <i>POWER </i>tokens. For example, since new <i>POWER </i>(post-Reset) is based on existing <i>ZERO </i>balances, anyone who owns less than 1/ <i>POWER </i>Initial Supply of a <i>ZERO </i>token will get 0 <i>POWER </i>after a Reset.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><i><b>POWER </b></i><b>Inflator </b>- The percentage inflation of the <i>POWER </i>supply per active epoch.

At 10% inflation, a <i>POWER </i>holder can expect to lose ~45% of their voting power if not participating for 6 epochs (note that epochs in our implementation correspond roughly to calendar months), ~70% of their voting power if not participating for 12 epochs, and ~90% of their voting power if not participating for 24 epochs. To a lesser extent this number should also take into account a realistic number of epochs with votable proposals to ensure that the operation of the protocol is not impacted by an overflow error.

See the diagram below for a visual example of the basic Minter economics.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Diagram demonstrating the basic economics of a Minter</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">It is also anticipated that Minters will engage in arbitrage. If <i>M </i>is trading above $1 on secondary markets, it is logical for Minters to deposit Eligible Collateral in order to generate more <i>M</i>. This will boost their net yield. Conversely, if <i>M </i>is trading below $1 on secondary markets, it is logical for Minters to repurchase <i>M </i>and to use it to Retrieve Eligible Collateral. This will also boost their net yield. It is for this reason that <i>M </i>is expected to trade with some volatility around (US)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">$1 – the mechanism relies on sometimes inefficient and unpredictable market forces to achieve an average price of $1 over the long term.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">A hypothetical price curve for <i>M </i>with expected Minter activity</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">There will be no built in mechanism at the protocol level to ensure the price stability of <i>M</i>; rather, that will be achieved via the economic incentives described and visualized above.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="IV.II"><h3 style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">Validators</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Economically, all Validators must be incentivized off-chain or use periphery smart contracts. There is no Validator compensation in the core protocol. This decision was made because the Validator landscape is complex and the chance of accurately encapsulating these complex economic arrangements on-chain was nil. For the basic function of providing signatures for Update Collateral, it is expected that Validators and Minters will enter into binding, off-chain legal agreements specifying applicable terms and appropriate compensation. It is anticipated that Validators in the M^0 protocol will eventually correspond to auditors off-chain. The ultimate function of the Validator is to provide as close to real time attestation of the Eligible Collateral being used to generate <i>M </i>as possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">While the protocol considers all Validator addresses to be fungible, there are in fact many specializations that could occur off-chain in the Validator ecosystem. For instance, there may be Validators that specialize in signing off on on-chain Collateral Value updates, while others act as “sentinels” and exclusively exist to call Cancel and Freeze on errant Minters. The level of specialization could even go beyond the initial methods of the protocol as periphery contracts are added by the ecosystem.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="IV.III"><h3 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -39pt;text-align: left;">Earners</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Earners are simply addresses approved by the TTG to earn the Earner Rate. It is expected that, throughout the cycle, the Earner Rate will remain comparable to the US Federal Funds rate as well in order to entice Earners to continue to hold <i>M</i>. The Earner Rate can be used as an additional tool to encourage <i>M </i>price stability around $1. If the price of <i>M </i>is above $1, the TTG can lower the Earner Rate in order to discourage holding of <i>M </i>and to encourage selling of <i>M </i>for alternative sources of yield. If the price of <i>M </i>is below $1, the TTG can raise the Earner Rate in order to encourage the holding and purchase of <i>M</i>. It should be noted that the Earner Rate can be higher than the Minter Rate as long as the amount of <i>M </i>being paid out via the Earner Rate is less than the amount of total <i>M </i>generated from Minter Rate.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">It is anticipated that Earners in the M^0 protocol will correspond to institutional holders of <i>M </i>off-chain, and to issuers and distributors that maintain <i>M </i>inventory. The ultimate function of Earners is as a source of demand for <i>M</i>, making it more likely that Minters can efficiently generate <i>M</i>. This is effectively to say that Earners align nicely with the ultimate distributors of <i>M </i>to the broader market.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Example: The TTG permissions a large cryptocurrency exchange to the Earners list. This exchange has millions of users and is regulated/licensed appropriately in the jurisdiction(s) it serves. Once permissioned, the exchange can use customer’s M to earn the Earner Rate. They can now pass a portion or all of the Earner Rate on to their customers.</p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Diagram showing how Earners may distribute <i>M </i>yield to end users</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="V."><h2 style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Off-Chain Ecosystem</h2><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The M^0 protocol relies on the presence of several off-chain actors and components, and a feedback process referred to as “guidance” to function properly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l9"><li data-list-text="V.I"><h3 style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Guidance</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">It is anticipated that as the M^0 ecosystem grows, an increasing number of stakeholders will have an interest in its continued development and improvement. These stakeholders are referred to as <i>Think Tanks</i>. Much as the Basel Committee and its cooperating international regulators</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">have provided (theoretically non-committal) guidance and rules for the banking sector, it is anticipated that similar groups and perhaps new M^0-specific institutions will provide guidance for the M^0 ecosystem and protocol. The protocol is designed in such a way that it can formally adopt guidance through a governance vote and enforce this guidance throughout the system via the Validators. It is intended to function as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Step 1: <span class="p">Think Tanks provide guidance.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Step 2: <span class="p">The TTG adopts or rejects this guidance by voting on a hash of a public document containing it.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Step 3: <span class="p">Permissioned Actors adjust their behavior accordingly.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Step 4: <span class="p">Validators withhold signatures, Cancel Propose IDs, or Freeze Minters who have not adjusted their behavior to be in line with the guidance.

These Think Tanks put out guidance amending the definition of an Eligible Custody Solution to include a list of appropriate jurisdictions, and stipulate that all Minters should be in compliance with this list within 180 days of the proposal’s execution. The document is hashed so that all actors can</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">validate they have the same and correct version of the guidance, and this hash is submitted to the TTG under a guidance list. The POWER holders will then vote on the proposal. If it passes, the guidance should be considered approved and enforceable. Once the 180 day window is complete (which is also defined in the guidance), Validators should begin to withhold signatures on Update Collateral calls from Minters that attempt to include Eligible Collateral held in an unapproved jurisdiction in their on-chain collateral value. Validators can also call Cancel or Freeze on a Minter that is errant in other ways not capturable in the Update Collateral Method. Validators not enforcing the approved guidance should expect to be removed by the TTG.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="V.II"><h3 style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: left;">Off-Chain Actors and Components</h3></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The following components and their associated guidance represent those contemplated for the launch of the protocol.
